# 計画的無作為

## 決定論
- Everything is determined
- Does free will exist?
- And everything is unpredictable

## 全ての決断は過去の経験に依存する
- Nature or Nurture
- 遺伝子 & 幼少期

## 完全計画の落とし穴
- Predictable things do not offer huge benefits
  - What's important is an accidental event
- You choose what you like based on your past experience
  - Is it really optimal?

## How to randomize it?


## What's your constant
- Passion
- Desire


### How to choose what to do
- Explore the Roots of Desire
- We want our species to thrive
- The desire may not always be necessary to achieve it
